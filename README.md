<p> Why did I chose UMaine?
I chose UMaine because, like I mentioned I wanted to come to a bigger school. However, I also came to visit my sister when she attended UMaine and right away it felt like home. It was a great campus and everyone was so friendly.
This was a major deciding factor when figuring out what college I wanted to attend. From the first moments stepping on campus, I knew this is where I wanted to be. </p>
